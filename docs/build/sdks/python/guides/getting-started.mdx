## Introduction

The Pieces SDK is a powerful code engine package designed for writing applications on top of Pieces OS. It facilitates communication with a locally hosted server to enable features such as copilot chats, asset saving, and more.

## Installation

To get started with the Pieces SDK, follow these steps:

1. **Download Pieces OS**: Pieces OS serves as the primary backend service, providing essential functionality for the SDK. Download the appropriate version for your operating system:
    - [macOS](/installation-getting-started/macos)
    - [Windows](/installation-getting-started/windows)
    - [Linux](/installation-getting-started/linux)

2. **Install the PyPI Package**: Use pip to install the Pieces SDK package:
    ```shell
    pip install pieces-os-client
    ```

## Usage
After installing the SDK, you can import the library into your project and start utilizing its features:

```shell
from pieces_os_client.models
```

## Features
The Pieces SDK offers the following key features:

1. Copilot Chats: Communicate seamlessly with copilot chats functionality.
2. Asset Management: Save and manage assets and formats efficiently.
3. Local Server Interaction: Interact with a locally hosted server for various functionalities.
4. Multi LLMs support: Use any Pieces supported LLMs to power apps.

## Requirements
The Pieces SDK has the following system requirements:

- Pieces OS running as a backend service.
- Python environment with pip for installing the SDK package.

## Testing Usage

Create a wellknown.py file and add this code to confirm you have installed the correct package:

```python
# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with pieces_os_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = pieces_os_client.WellKnownApi(api_client)

    try:
        # api_instance.get_well_known_version() [Get]
        api_response = api_instance.get_well_known_version()
        print("The response of WellKnownApi->get_well_known_version:\n")
        print(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling WellKnownApi->get_well_known_version: %s\n" % e)
```

**Your output should appear on your IDE terminal stating the version of the Pieces OS installed.**

## Examples
Here are some examples of the basic endpoint for getting up and running:

<details>
  <summary>Connect</summary>

  When developing and creating an application on top of Pieces OS, it is important that you authenticate with the application itself when performing requests.

  To 'connect' your application (this Python project) to the server, you will need to make a POST request to the `api_instance.connect()` endpoint of the API and print the response.

  ```python
  # Enter a context with an instance of the API client
  with pieces_os_client.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
      # Create an instance of the API class
      api_instance = pieces_os_client.ConnectorApi(api_client)
      seeded_connector_connection = pieces_os_client.SeededConnectorConnection()
      # SeededConnectorConnection |  (optional)

      try:
          # api_instance.connect() [POST]
          api_response = api_instance.connect(seeded_connector_connection=seeded_connector_connection)
          print("The response of ConnectorApi->connect:\n")
          print(api_response)
      except Exception as e:
          print("Exception when calling ConnectorApi->connect: %s\n" % e)
  ```
</details>
