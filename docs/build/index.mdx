Pieces provides SDK libraries for major programming languages like Python, Dart, Kotlin and TypeScript so you don't have to write code for interacting with our API protocols from scratch.

We're always working on improving and extending the current stack of available SDKs and SDK documentation, listed below is a list of official SDKS the Pieces team is maintaining.

## Explore Our SDKs

<GridFlexRow type={'evenly'}>
  {activeSDKs.map((sdk) => (
    <CTAButton
      key={sdk}
      label={`${sdk} SDK`}
      href={`sdks/${sdk}/guides/getting-started`}
      icon={`/assets/languages/${sdk}_logo.png`}
      type={'secondary'}
    />
  ))}
</GridFlexRow>
