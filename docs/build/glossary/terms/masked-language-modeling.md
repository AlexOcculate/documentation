Masked Language Modeling is a language modeling task where some tokens in the input are masked and the model is trained to predict the masked tokens. Masked Language Modeling is a type of unsupervised learning task where the model is trained to predict the masked tokens in the input text. Masked Language Modeling is a key component of many state-of-the-art natural language processing models, such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and RoBERTa (A Robustly Optimized BERT Approach).
