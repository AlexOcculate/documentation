# Pieces Specific

### Activities

Activities are a way to track and manage the progress of tasks and projects within Pieces OS. They enable users to create, assign, and track the progress of tasks, as well as manage dependencies and resources. Activities can be linked to specific projects, allowing for efficient project management and collaboration.

### Accessor

An accessor is a feature that tracks who has accessed a shared snippet and how many times they have accessed it. It keeps a record of the user who accessed the shared snippet (if they were logged in) and the number of times they accessed it.

### Aesthetics

Aesthetics are a set of properties that control the visual appearance of an object, such as its color, size, and shape.

### Analysis

Analysis is an object used for storing various analysis models like image analysis and code analysis.

### Anchor

An anchor is a reference to a specific file or folder location on a machine. It is used for conversations, referencing the origin of the code snippet.

### Annotation

An annotation is a versatile tool that facilitates the addition of comments, summaries, and various other types of annotations to enhance understanding and provide additional context.

### Application

An application is used to identify the source of a format/analytics event. It provides information such as the application name, version number, platform, onboarding status, privacy settings, capabilities, mechanism, and automatic unload flag.

### Context

Context contains information about the current context or state of the application.

### Context Awareness

Context awareness is the capability of Pieces to gather information about some codeâ€™s context or environment at any given time.

### Distribution

A distribution object represents a channel through which notifications can be sent. Currently, Pieces supports distribution for GitHub, with each distribution having its own unique set of properties and configuration options.

### Edges

The 'Edges' object represents a collection of nodes in a graph structure.

### Health

The health model is a read-only model that provides information about the health of the OS server, including properties such as the OS health and the schema version.

### Hint

The hint model is used to provide hints and suggested queries for assets, including properties such as the hint text, the mechanism by which the hint was generated, and the asset to which the hint is attached.

### Linkify

The Linkify API generates a publicly sharable link for a code snippet, expecting an asset for the snippet and generating the link once the asset is passed into the API.

### Reaction

The Reaction endpoint is used to react to the response given from the suggestion endpoint, allowing for a hybrid approach of user interaction/confirmation and auto-recommended uploads.

### Recipients

Recipients is an iterable of People that are attached to a specific distribution, used in tandem with the Distribution endpoint to describe which distribution is being used.

### Relationship

A relationship expresses a graph of like types to build a relationship graph,to build a relationship graph, requiring iteration through edges to get the root or simply getting the first edge's type as a relationship can only be expressed through the same type.

### Role

This is the specific role of a format.

### Score

Score is a model present for all materials, both plural and singular, that can be incremented individually as users use specific materials. This is relevant to specific algorithms used for the Feed and to determine which materials or actions to show.

### Sensitives

A 'sensitive' is defined as a piece of information that may be of a sensitive nature, such as an API key or service account, automatically extracted and linked into the assets creation.

### Tag

This field displays any relevant tags or keywords assigned to your code snippet, used to group, organize, and search various assets.

### Related people

Related people help to search through known users to pinpoint a person who could help understand/work with a given snippet, extending to natural language questions about specific programming problems or codebases.

### Relevance

Relevance refers to all the relevant or useful information used to ground the model to better answer your question or query, specific to the qGPT flow.

### OS Instance

Provides information to Pieces OS about the operating system being used by the host system.

### Enrich

Enrich enables developers to modify the enrichment levels of the persons, tags, and websites associated with an asset, ensuring the number of people/tags/websites does not exceed the provided value.

### Smart Transforms

Quickly transform code snippets with a single click to improve readability, format, and runtime performance, translate to your preferred language, or convert to boilerplate effortlessly.

### Associate

Associate endpoints are used to build relationships between materials, like associating a related website or a tag with an asset.

### Ghost Assets

Ghost assets enable assets that are added to Pieces but not included in typical snapshots, allowing for internal addition of assets without returning them to a user unless explicitly stated.

### Disassociate

Endpoints used to remove a relationship, such as removing a tag from an asset after using an associate endpoint.
