LLM fine-tuning is the process of adjusting a pre-trained AI model's parameters so it can perform better on specific tasks or datasets. Fine-tuning large language models is particularly beneficial when the model needs to adapt to specific or niche tasks where general models might not perform well without adjustments. It is also helpful when data privacy requirements restrict the use of broad datasets.
