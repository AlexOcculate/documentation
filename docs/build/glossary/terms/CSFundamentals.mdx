# CS Fundamentals

### PKCE Flow

Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) is an extension of the OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow that enhances security by eliminating the need to securely store and manage client secrets. It uses a randomly generated code verifier and code challenge pair that is exchanged for an access token, ensuring that the authorization code cannot be intercepted and reused maliciously.

### Auth0 User

In Pieces, an Auth0 User represents a user who has been authenticated through Auth0.

### OCR

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts scanned or printed images into machine-readable text. It analyzes the image, identifies characters and symbols, and transforms them into digital text that can be stored, edited, and searched. OCR has applications in various industries, including document digitization, data entry automation, and image analysis.

### Reverse Proxy Tunnel

A reverse proxy tunnel acts as an intermediary server that forwards requests from clients to a target server at a different location. It allows applications or services running on internal networks to be securely accessed from external sources by creating a tunnel that masks the actual network topology and provides additional layers of protection.

### WSL

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) enables the running of a Linux environment directly on Windows 10 or 11 systems. It allows developers and users to access and work with Linux tools, applications, and shell commands within the Windows operating system, simplifying cross-platform development and application deployment.

### Backtracking

Backtracking is an algorithmic technique used to solve problems by systematically exploring all possible solutions. It involves recursively testing each option and backtracking if the current path leads to a dead end. Backtracking algorithms are employed in various scenarios, including game-solving, optimization problems, and graph traversal.

### Iterable

Iterable refers to an array-like data structure that represents a sequence of elements. It allows for efficient traversal through each element, one at a time. In the Pieces SDK, we specifically use the term Iterable to denote arrays.

### Telemetry

Telemetry is the collection, transmission, and analysis of data related to the performance, usage, and health of systems or devices. It provides valuable insights into how systems are behaving, enabling troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and optimization. Telemetry is commonly used in industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, and IT operations.

### Formats

Formats refer to the specific structures or representations used to encode, store, and transmit data. These include file formats (e.g., JPEG, PDF), database formats (e.g., JSON, XML), and communication protocols (e.g., HTTP, TCP). Formats provide a standardized way of exchanging and processing data across different systems and applications.

### Plural API versus singular API

In API design, we utilize both plural and singular APIs based on the operation's nature. Plural APIs are used to handle multiple resources (such as create, delete, and full snapshots with many materials) at once. Singular APIs are used to handle single resources, like updates and specific snapshots.

### TLP Code Processing

TLP stands for Technical Language Processing, Itâ€™s quite similar to NLP (Natural Language Processing). TLP specifically focuses on processing technical language, particularly code. It involves techniques to understand, analyze, and derive insights from code.

### Language Server Protocol

Language Server Protocol (LSP) is an open, JSON-RPC-based protocol for use between source code editors or integrated development environments (IDEs) and servers that provide language intelligence tools
