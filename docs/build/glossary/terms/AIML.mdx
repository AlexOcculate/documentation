### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Combines retrieval-based and generative-based approaches to generate responses by retrieving relevant information from a large corpus. RAG is a text generation technique that combines retrieval-based and generative-based approaches. It involves retrieving relevant information from a large corpus of text and then using that information to generate new text. RAG can be used for a variety of tasks, such as question-answering, summarization, and translation.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

LLMs are a type of neural network that has been trained on diverse datasets, including vast amounts of text and, increasingly, multimodal data such as images, audio, and video. These models can learn to understand and generate human-like text, and they have been used for a variety of tasks, such as language translation, text summarization, and question-answering.

### Classification

Classification is a machine-learning task that involves assigning a label to an input data point. For example, a classification model could be used to classify emails as spam or not spam or to classify images as cats or dogs.

### Embedding

Embedding is a technique that converts discrete data into a continuous vector space. This allows the data to be processed by machine learning models, which typically require continuous input data. For example, word embeddings can be used to represent the meaning of words in a text document.

### Patterns Engine

A patterns engine is a software tool that can be used to identify and extract patterns from data. These patterns can then be used for a variety of purposes, such as fraud detection, anomaly detection, and text classification.

### Quantized Generative Pre-trained Transformer (qGPT)

qGPT is a quantized version of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) language model. Quantization is a technique that reduces the size and computational cost of a neural network model by reducing the precision of its weights. qGPT can be used for a variety of tasks, such as text generation, language translation, and question answering.

### qGPTseeds

qGPTseeds are a set of pre-trained models for the qGPT language model. These models can be used for a variety of tasks, such as text generation, language translation, and question-answering.

### Copilot

An AI copilot is a development assistant that can help generate, answer questions about, troubleshoot, and debug code. Copilots can suggest code completions, generate entire functions, and even help to debug code.

### Small Language Models

Small language models are a type of AI that can understand and generate human language. They are typically trained on a large dataset of text, and they learn to identify patterns in the language. This allows them to generate new text that is both coherent and grammatically correct.
