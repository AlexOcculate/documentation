Vector Search is a search technique that uses vector representations of documents and queries to find relevant documents. In Vector Search, documents and queries are represented as vectors in a high-dimensional vector space, where the distance between vectors is used to measure the similarity between documents and queries. Vector Search is commonly used in information retrieval systems, recommendation systems, and natural language processing tasks. Vector Search is based on the idea that similar documents and queries will have similar vector representations, and therefore can be retrieved efficiently using vector similarity measures such as cosine similarity or Euclidean distance. Vector Search is a key component of many state-of-the-art search engines and recommendation systems, such as Elasticsearch, Solr, and Annoy.
