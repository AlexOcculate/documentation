# Search

### Global Search

Global Search is a feature that allows users to search across all of their assets, regardless of where they are stored or what type of asset they are. With Global Search, users can search across all of their assets, including files, notes, code snippets, and more. They can also search within specific folders or projects, and filter their results by type, date, or other criteria. Global Search is a great way to save time and stay organized, and it can help users to be more productive in their work.

### Discovery API

The Discovery API provides endpoints for discovering assets, HTML webpages, sensitives, and related tags.

### FTS

Full-text search (FTS) is a search method that allows users to find assets by searching for specific words or phrases within the content of those assets. Unlike fuzzy matching, FTS doesn't understand different spellings or sentence structures. So, the search terms must match the exact text in the assets to be found.

### Indices

This is a map of IDs or identifiers that map to a value which is an integer from -1 -> infinity. These index Maps are only on plural Models, such as Asset.websites, Asset.tags, or Assets, ...XYZ (in these cases Tags/Websites/Assets, but not limited to just these). A uuid will map to an int, which is its place in the iterable (array) on the plural models. This will also let us know what was previously referenced but removed, signaled with a -1, and will get fully cleared on shut down and boot up.

### Neural Code Search

Neural Code Search (NCS) is a method that leverages neural networks to find similar code snippets within a codebase based on natural language queries. It converts the code into a vector of numbers, and then uses those numbers to compare to other vectors to find similar code. This allows NCS to find similar code even if it is written in different languages or has different variable names.
