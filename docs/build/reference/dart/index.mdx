## Introduction
The Pieces SDK is a powerful code engine package designed for writing applications on top of [Pieces OS](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing). It facilitates communication with a locally hosted server to enable features such as copilot chats, asset saving, and more.

:::info

The Pieces Dart SDK is not yet available on pub.dev. To use the SDK, you must clone the repository and add it as a dependency in your Dart project.

:::

## Requirements
The Pieces SDK has the following system requirements:

- [Pieces OS](/installation-getting-started/what-am-i-installing) running as a backend service.

## Installation
To get started with the Pieces SDK, follow these steps:

1. **Download Pieces OS**: Pieces OS serves as the primary backend service, providing essential functionality for the SDK. Download the appropriate version for your operating system:

    <GridFlexRow type={'start'}>
      <CTAButton
      href="/installation-getting-started/windows"
      label={"Get Pieces for Windows"}
      icon={'/assets/windows_logo_old.png'}
      type={'secondary'}
      />
      <CTAButton
      href="/installation-getting-started/macos"
      label={"Get Pieces for macOS"}
      icon={'/assets/mac_os.png'}
      iconDark={'/assets/mac_os_dark.png'}
      type={'secondary'}
      />
      <CTAButton
      href="/installation-getting-started/linux"
      label={"Get Pieces for Linux"}
      icon={'/assets/linux_logo.png'}
      type={'secondary'}
      />
    </GridFlexRow>

2. **Add the SDK dependency**: Add the SDK dependency to your Dart project by adding the following to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
   ```dart
   dependencies:
     pieces_os_client:
       path: /path/to/pieces_os_client
   ```

## Getting Started

We will create a Dart script to test the connection to the Pieces OS server.

Create a `main.dart` file and add the following code:

```dart title="main.dart"
import 'package:pieces_os_client/api.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final api_instance = WellKnownApi();

  try {
    final result = await api_instance.getWellKnownHealth();
    print(result);
  } catch (e) {
    print('Exception when calling WellKnownApi->getWellKnownHealth: $e\n');
  }
}
```
Run the Dart script to see the output:

```shell
dart main.dart
```

**The output should appear in your terminal stating the version of Pieces OS that is installed on your machine.**

## Next Steps

If you've made it this far, that means you've successfully connected to your local Pieces OS server using our Dart SDK! You can now explore the various endpoints available in the SDK to build your application on top of Pieces OS.
