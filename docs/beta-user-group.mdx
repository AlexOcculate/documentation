## The Next Phase of Pieces for Developers
Thank you so much for being one of the very first beta tests for Pieces for Developers. You are now an active player in our product development process and we are so grateful to you for being here.

This page outlines all the information you will need to know to be a participant in the **workstream context** beta test. We will keep this page updated as much as possible but the active communication will be taking place on Discord, so if you have not joined there please [do so now](https://discord.gg/qPd2748b7s).

## What Are We Testing?
Pieces for Developers has thus far been a productivity tool that is integrated into all of your tools using plugins/extensions, and allows users to have deep contextual conversations when they manually add context from folders, files, snippets, etc. While this is useful and the users love it, we want to go one step further.

Our goal is to become the very first copilot that knows what you were doing during the last few hours, and can speak to your workflow without you having to tell it what to look at. We are calling this workstream context, and we believe that we should gather and serve this to you proactively.

## The Workstream Pattern Engine
The workflow context will come from the workstream pattern engine, an "always on" system that follows you through your workflow to capture relevant workflow materials and bring all relevant context to your conversations with the Pieces copilot, with the goal of helping you customize your conversations to your personal workflow and bring greater value to the assistance the copilot can offer you.

The workstream pattern engine will start working once we enable your account on a specific version of Pieces OS and Pieces Desktop App. Shortly after, you will be able to interact with it through the Pieces Desktop copilot via a new "Workstream Pipeline".

## Data and Privacy
**Your workflow data is stored and processed entirely on your device, and deleted after 6 hours.** At no point will anyone, including the Pieces team, have access to this data unless you choose to share it with us.

The workstream pattern engine only takes relevant information from the applications and windows you are focused on. It uses our in-house vision models to extract information, filters it for sensitives, including secrets, and then indexes any extracted text which then contextualizes your copilot.

Please note that if you interact with the workstream pattern engine using a cloud LLM as your copilot’s runtime, only text relevant to your query is sent to the LLM. You can avoid this entirely by using a local model. If you are unfamiliar with using local models, please know that you will need a fairly new machine (2021 and newer) and ideally a dedicated GPU for this. You can read [this blog](https://code.pieces.app/blog/how-to-run-an-llm-locally-with-pieces) for more information about running local models on your machine.

**Please note that you may pause the workstream pattern engine at any time, and we can remove you from the beta and clear your data at any time if you request it.** Details on how to pause or opt-out may be found below.

At the end of the beta test, we will remove all data related to this test from your machine.

## Goals of the Beta Test
Our main priority for this test is to test the workstream pattern engine with as much variance as possible, in what tasks you are doing, what apps you are using, and what machine and display you are working on. From you, we want to hear pain points, any confusion you have regarding how the feature works, if you feel it adds value to your daily workflow, and **how we can make it more valuable.**

Additionally, and only if you are comfortable sharing, we would love to gather raw data from you, so we can improve our vision processing stack. **This is absolutely not required.** This will only be used by the engineers at Pieces to improve the way we filter out irrelevant information.

## Beta Tester Expectations
As part of our beta user group, you will be expected to:
1. Use the workstream context pipeline as often as makes sense with your workflow, minimum ten times during the beta testing period. We’re aiming to release this the week of April 8-12 with the intention of running the test for two weeks.
2. Report any bugs you find in the discord group, and be willing to join a live call if necessary to debug.
3. Provide regular feedback during the test via conversations and quick responses in the discord
4. Complete a survey at the end of your experience detailing your experience with the workstream pattern engine.

## Communication
Our main form of communication will be via Discord, so please join our discord using [this link](https://discord.gg/qPd2748b7s) if you haven’t already, which will place you in the beta group channel. If you’re already a Discord user please DM mason-at-pieces on Discord and he will add you to the channel.

## Toggling On/Off
You can toggle the workstream pattern engine off at any time if you are working on something that you do not want to be used as context for conversations. You do this in several places:
1. In the main application settings of the desktop app
2. A setting within the copilot view
3. A toggle on the Pieces OS dropdown

## Opting In/Out

If you decide to completely opt-out of this beta test, you can do this in the main settings of the desktop app under "Account & Integrations." We will remove all data related to this test if you do this.

## Best Practices
As with any interaction with an LLM, good prompting practices will improve your experience greatly. The copilot will have access to the applications, windows, and file names that you have been interacting with, and therefore you can ask specific questions about anything you’ve been focused on in the last six hours, such as:

Can you summarize the readme file from the pieces_for_x repo?
What did Sam have to say about the All Hands meeting in the gchat MLChat channel?
Generate a script in python using the function I saw on W3Schools to create a variable named xyz
Take the function from example_function.dart and add it as a method to the class in example_class.dart
What did Mark say about requests to the xyz api in slack?

## Help and Support
If you need any assistance during the beta test, please either post in the Discord group or reach out directly to rosie@pieces.app
